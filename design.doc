SAMPLE RUN:

Please enter your car's mpg: 22
Please enter gas price per gallon: 3.5

Your gas cost for 20 miles is 3.18 dollors!
Your gas cost for 75 miles is 11.93 dollors!
Your gas cost for 500 miles is 79.54 dollors!


===========================================================
DESIGN:

a) Inputs

car's mpg as a double
gas price per gallon as a double

-----------------------------------------------------------
b) Outputs

gas cost for 20 miles as a double
gas cost for 75 mile as a double
gas cost for 500 miles as a double

-----------------------------------------------------------
c) Calculations

gas cost = miles / car's mpg * gas price per gallon 

-----------------------------------------------------------
d) Pseudocode

DECLARE Double milePerGallon
DECLARE Double pricePerGallon
DECLARE Double gasCost20Miles
DECLARE Double gasCost75Miles
DECLARE Double gasCost500Miles

DISPLAY "Please enter your car's mpg: "
INPUT milePerGallon

DISPLAY "Please enter gas price per gallon: "
INPUT pricePerGallon

SET gasCost20Miles = 20 / car's mpg * gas price per gallon
SET gasCost75Miles = 75 / car's mpg * gas price per gallon
SET gasCost500Miles = 500 / car's mpg * gas price per gallon
